# AI Operator Guide

This file is for AI assistants, coding agents, and automation tools.

## Goal

Help the user make historical Codex sessions visible again after switching `model_provider`.

For normal Windows users, prefer the GUI app when it is available. Use the CLI when:

- the user explicitly wants commands
- the task is automated
- the GUI EXE is unavailable

The tool works by updating both:

- rollout metadata under `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`
- SQLite thread metadata in `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`

Do not solve this by manually editing rollout files only unless the user explicitly asks for manual intervention.

## Preferred Flow

Use this order by default:

1. If the GUI is available and the user is not asking for terminal commands, open `CodexProviderBridge.exe`
2. Refresh and inspect the current provider plus rollout/SQLite distribution
3. Decide whether the user needs sync, switch-like behavior, or restore
4. Execute the action
5. Report whether the result is complete or partially skipped due to locked files

CLI fallback flow:

1. Run `codex-bridge status`
2. Read `Current provider` and compare rollout/SQLite distribution
3. Decide whether the user needs `sync`, `switch`, or `restore`
4. Run the command
5. Report whether the result is complete or partially skipped due to locked files

## Command Selection

Use `codex-bridge sync` when:

- the user already switched auth/provider using another tool
- the current `config.toml` root `model_provider` is already correct
- the user says things like:
  - "make my old sessions visible again"
  - "resync my Codex history"
  - "I already switched provider"

Use `codex-bridge switch <provider-id>` when:

- the user wants to change the root `model_provider`
- the user wants one command to both switch provider and resync history

Use `codex-bridge restore <backup-dir>` when:

- the user wants to roll back a previous sync
- the user synced to the wrong provider

Use `codex-bridge status` only when:

- the user asks for inspection only
- you need a safe first step before deciding what to do

## GUI Selection

Use the GUI app when:

- the user wants a double-click tool
- the user does not want to install Node/npm
- the user wants to visually inspect providers and backups

GUI mapping:

- `Refresh` = inspect current status
- `Execute` without config checkbox = `sync --provider <selected>`
- `Execute` with config checkbox = switch-like behavior
- `Restore Backup` = restore a previous backup
- backup retention defaults to 5 and can be customized in the GUI
- `Clean Old Backups` = prune managed backups down to the selected retention count

## Important Behavior

- `sync` uses the current root `model_provider` from `~/.codex/config.toml`
- if root `model_provider` is missing, `sync` falls back to `openai`
- `switch` changes root `model_provider`, then runs a sync
- built-in `openai` is always valid
- custom providers must already exist in `config.toml`
- the tool does not log the user in and does not manage `auth.json`
- sync and switch create a backup first, then automatically prune older managed backups
- backup pruning only touches backups created by this tool under `backups_state/provider-sync`

## Error Handling

If the output says `state_5.sqlite is currently in use`:

- tell the user to close Codex, Codex App, and app-server
- then rerun the same command

If sync reports `Skipped locked rollout files`:

- treat the sync as mostly successful
- explain that the active session still holds one or more rollout files open
- tell the user to rerun `codex-bridge sync` after that session ends if they want a full rewrite

If `switch <provider-id>` fails because the provider is missing:

- tell the user to define it in `config.toml` or switch via their existing provider tool first
- then run `codex-bridge sync`

## Safe Defaults

- default Codex home: `~/.codex`
- prefer `status` before destructive-looking operations, even though this tool only edits metadata
- by default the tool keeps the most recent 5 managed backups
- use GUI retention settings or CLI `--keep <n>` when the user wants a different retention count
- do not edit `state_5.sqlite` or rollout files manually if the tool can do it
- GUI settings live in `%AppData%\codex-provider-bridge\settings.json`

## Recommended Commands

```bash
codex-bridge status
codex-bridge sync
codex-bridge sync --keep 5
codex-bridge sync --provider openai
codex-bridge switch apigather
codex-bridge prune-backups --keep 5
codex-bridge restore C:\Users\you\.codex\backups_state\provider-sync\20260319T042708906Z
```

With an explicit Codex home:

```bash
codex-bridge status --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-bridge sync --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-bridge switch openai --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
```

## One-Shot Prompt Template

Use this prompt in another AI tool if the user wants one-step handling:

```text
I use codex-provider-bridge. Please help me fix Codex session visibility under my current provider.

Steps:
1. Run `codex-bridge status`.
2. If my current provider is already correct, run `codex-bridge sync`.
3. If I explicitly tell you to switch provider, run `codex-bridge switch <provider-id>` instead.
4. If SQLite is locked, tell me to close Codex / Codex App / app-server and retry.
5. If rollout files are skipped because they are locked, tell me which ones were skipped and remind me to rerun sync later.
6. Summarize the final state of rollout files and SQLite after the command finishes.
```

## User-Facing Summary Style

When reporting results back to the user:

- state the current provider
- state whether rollout files and SQLite are aligned
- mention backup location if a sync or switch was executed
- call out partial success clearly if locked rollout files were skipped
